# rust-algorithms
My implementation of different algorithms made using Rust.

Just note that the implementations are not optimized(or at least doesnt try to be the most optimized) and are just here for educational purposes with a simple and (hopefully) readable code.

Each folder is a standalone cargo project.

Algorithms Todo:
 - Binary search
 - Kadane's Algorithm
 - Longest Increasing Subsequence Problem
