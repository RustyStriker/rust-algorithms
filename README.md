# rust-algorithms
My implementation of different algorithms made using Rust.

Just note that the implementations are not optimized(or at least doesnt try to be the most optimized) and are just here for educational purposes with a simple and (hopefully) readable code.

Each folder is a standalone cargo project.

Algorithms Todo:
 - Longest Increasing Subsequence Problem


Image recognition and camera feeds:
 - Get camera feed into rust(rscam) / Read a photo
 - actually learn computer vision
